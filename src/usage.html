		Everything can be done from the <a href="index.html">index.html</a> page on the website or from going to <a href="doaction.php">doaction.php</a> passing in the action and the relevant parameters in the url. Example: <a href="doaction.php?action=register&username=test&password=test">doaction.php?action=register&username=test&password=test</a>

	<h2>
		Notes
	</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>setguildmaster doesn't remove username2 from members, if one wants to do that, kick username2 from the guild, then set them as the guildmaster</li>
		<li>leaving as guildmaster also disbands the guild (kicking everyone from the guild), so if you're the guildmaster and want to leave, but don't want to end the guild, setguildmaster to anyone you want to give the guild to before you leave</li>
		<li>if one wants to make it so that members of a guild at a certain rank can have guildmaster priviledges, just make a guildmaster user and then give the password of the guildmaster user to users that get to that rank</li>
	</ul>
